# R_Modeling_Projects
Examples of the RStudio and RMarkdown projects I've completed throughout my academic and professional experience. 

This repository is being created to upload all my past software projects in RStudio. I am a graduate of Calfornia State University Monterey Bay with a B.S. in Mathematics with Concentration in Statistics.
